# JavaFX Calculator Application

## Requirements
In order to use this application you need to have **.jar** files. These files are from [this website](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/). After obtaining these .jar files, you will just need this project, java, and scenebuilder. Scenebuilder is what JavaFX uses to generate the graphics.

## Usage
This program is used to Calculate any single step equation. You are able to give any equation to the calculator but it will only work if it one step.

## How it Works
When entering the application you can find a button for each number, 0-9, four operations, a clear button, and an equals button. If you click multiple number buttons before giving an operation, the numbers will stack up. For example, if you click 8 and then 4 with no operation in the middle you will get 84. If you were to click equals after clicking 8 then 4, then you would get an error saying that you need another operation and a number. Anything without two numbers and an operation will give you an error.

#I Hope that you enjoy the application
